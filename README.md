The project develops an all-in-one puzzle game app called <b>Word Master</b> featuring word-
based games like <b>Four Letters</b>, <b>Word Hunt</b>, <b>Word Connect</b>, and <b>Word Search</b>. Its goal is to offer
a platform for cognitive engagement, language skill improvement, and fun. Each game mode
accommodates various difficulty levels and user preferences, ensuring a diverse experience with
intuitive interfaces, smooth navigation, and scoring systems.

<b>Word Hunt</b> is a key part of the project, providing an engaging puzzle
experience that challenges players with word formation and identification tasks. This game en-
hances cognitive skills such as vocabulary, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, designed
for accessibility and replayability to attract a broad audience.
